But in Vivaldi&amp;rsquo;s day, people would have clapped (or indeed booed, jeered and thrown fruit) whenever the mood took them. For the sake of not being glared at by people who think they know better than you, we recommend avoiding applauding until the end of the work.</description></item><item><title>About the choir</title><link>https://aucs-choral.github.io/2022.06-vivaldi-programme/choir/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aucs-choral.github.io/2022.06-vivaldi-programme/choir/</guid><description>Adelaide University Choral Society AUCS is a student club affiliated with the Adelaide University Union, founded in 1960. University of Adelaide staff and alumni also sing with the choir. We typically perform two classical concerts per year as well as a contemporary Fringe show. We have performed works from the 1500s to contemporary compositions, including motets and madrigals, masses and songs for the masses.
