AUCS is a student club affiliated with the Adelaide University Union, founded in 1960. University of Adelaide staff and alumni also sing with the choir. We typically perform two classical concerts per year as well as a contemporary Fringe show. We have performed works from the 1500s to contemporary compositions, including motets and madrigals, masses and songs for the masses.

An experienced solo and ensemble singer, Riana Chakravarti is an inaugural member of ACS², and has performed with Adelaide Chamber Singers, Graduate Singers, Adelaide Hills Chamber Players, and many other choirs. They have been a Pilgrim Uniting Church choral scholar since 2015.

Recent performance highlights include solo and chorus participation in the world premiere of *Watershed: The Death of Dr Duncan* in Adelaide Festival 2022, chorus in *Requiem* in Adelaide Festival 2020, solo and ensemble singing in the 2019 Australian premiere of *Considering Matthew Shepard*, and solos for Norwood Symphony Orchestra (Mendelssohn’s *Elijah*) and Adelaide University Choral Society (Dvořák’s *Stabat Mater*).

Riana is looking forward to a busy winter performing in a series of concerts with Adelaide Hills Chamber Players, singing chorus in Mopoke Productions’ upcoming performances of Puccini’s *Suor Angelica*, and singing the contralto solos in Purcell’s *Hail, bright Cecilia* with Adelaide Harmony Choir.

In their spare time, Riana is an arts administrator for Adelaide Choral Network and Adelaide Symphony Orchestra. They are delighted to sing solo once again for AUCS, a group that nurtured their love of choral singing for many years.

## Suzanne Wilson
*Soprano*

![Suzanne Wilson](suzanne.jpg)

Suzanne was a Special Music student at Brighton High School before gaining a B Mus (Perf) (Hons) at the Elder Conservatorium of Music under Jiri Tancibudek in 1987.  After a time as an oboist—ad hoc with Adelaide Symphony Orchestra, the State Opera Orchestra of SA and full-time with the Band of the South Australia Police—during which she also sang with Adelaide Chamber Singers, Corinthian Singers and Graduate Singers, Suzanne left Adelaide in 1991 to forge a career as a choral and Early Music specialist soprano in London. 
 
She has sung with professional ensembles Steve Reich and Musicians (with Synergy Vocals), the BBC Singers, The Sixteen, The King’s Consort, Gabrieli Consort and Philharmonia Voices. Her voice is on many film and video game soundtracks, including several in the Harry Potter series; and she appeared on screen in series 1 of *Call the Midwife*.
 
As a professional chorister, Suzanne has sung with Westminster Abbey Special Service Choir, St Paul’s Cathedral Consort and the choirs of Westminster Cathedral, St Margaret’s Westminster, St Bride’s Fleet Street, London Oratory and St George’s Hanover Square (Handel’s church), amongst numerous other London churches.  She was Cantor at St Mary-le-Bow, where she performed Bach cantatas in a liturgical context. 
 
Suzanne returned to Adelaide in March 2020 to be with her family during the Covid-19 pandemic, and has decided to stay.
