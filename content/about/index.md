![Peter Kelsall](peter.jpg)

Peter Kelsall completed his Bachelor of Music degree in 1989 at Adelaide University studying piano with Zelda Bock. He commenced organ studies with Christa Rumsey in 1987 and completed a Graduate Diploma in Performance on the instrument in 1993. In 1998 he completed his Masters Degree in Music Theory. He also holds a Certificate in Church Music from the Flinders Street School of Music TAFE and has undertaken studies in choral conducting with Carl Crossin.

As an organist Peter has given recitals in the Adelaide Town Hall, St. Peter’s Cathedral, Pilgrim Church and at various locations for the Organ Music Society of Adelaide for which he was a committee member for a number of years. He has played with the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra on many occasions over the last 20 years, including performances of Saint Saens’ ‘Organ’ Symphony, Holst’s Planets, Handel’s Messiah, Mahler’s Symphony no. 2, the 2010 Adelaide Festival performances of Ligeti’s opera Le Grande Macabre, Mahler’s Symphony no. 8 and the 2020  Adelaide Festival performances of Mozart’s Requiem. 

Peter has performed with many Adelaide choirs, including the Adelaide Chamber Singers, Syntony, Adelaide Philharmonia Chorus, Graduate Singers, Corinthian Singers, Elder Conservatorium Chorale, Kapelle Singers and the Adelaide and Flinders Universities Choral Societies.

In 1995 he was appointed Organist and Choir Director at Pilgrim Uniting Church in the city where he continues to build on this church’s strong musical tradition. In the mid 2000s Pilgrim established a tradition of ‘importing’ some of the world’s best organists to Adelaide to play for services and to give recitals on the church’s organ (South Australia’s largest). As a result of this initiative Peter has had the opportunity in recent years to work with highly distinguished organists including Thomas Trotter, David Goode, Benjamin Bayl, Benjamin Sheen, Clive Driskill-Smith, Simon Preston, John Scott, Daniel Roth and Olivier Latry.

In December 2017 and January 2018 Peter directed the Choirs of Pilgrim Church and Christ Church North Adelaide on their English Cathedrals Tour. The Choirs sang Evensongs in some 10 English cathedrals, including Lincoln, Durham, Salisbury, Winchester, Gloucester and York Minster. He will be conducting the Choir of Pilgrim Church on a further tour of the UK in 2022/23.

An honorary life member of the Adelaide University Choral Society, he has been their Musical Director since 1997. With AUCS he has conducted a wide range of repertoire, from Palestrina to Pink Floyd and most things in between. In January 2019 Peter directed the acclaimed ‘Northern Lights’ concert for the Australian Intervarsity Choral Festival held in Adelaide.

Peter is in demand as an accompanist and has been associated with a number of choirs in this capacity. He also teaches piano, organ, and music theory and works as an accompanist and music tutor at Walford Anglican School.
