#### A note about applause

*Unlike nearly every other form of entertainment, which encourages the communication of enjoyment, it has become a custom in the classical music world since the early 20th century not to applaud between movements of a larger work such as a concerto, mass or requiem. But in Vivaldi's day, people would have clapped (or indeed booed, jeered and thrown fruit) whenever the mood took them. For the sake of not being glared at by people who think they know better than you, we recommend avoiding applauding until the end of the work.*
