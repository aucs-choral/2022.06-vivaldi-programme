***A note about applause***

*Unlike nearly every other form of entertainment, which encourages the communication of enjoyment, it has become a custom in the classical music world not to applaud between movements of a larger work such as a concerto, mass or requiem. (As a tip to anyone who finds themself in what they fear might be a classical concert and isn’t sure of the etiquette, just don’t be the first to applaud, and you’ll be fine!)*
