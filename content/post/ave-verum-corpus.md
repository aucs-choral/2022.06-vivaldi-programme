*Ave verum corpus, natum de Maria virgine, vere passum, immolatum in cruce pro homine, cuius latus perforatum unda fluxit aqua et sanguine: esto nobis prægustatum in mortis examine.*

Hail, true Body, born of the Virgin Mary, who having truly suffered, was sacrificed on the cross for mankind, whose pierced side flowed with water and blood: may it be for us a foretaste [of the Heavenly banquet] in the trial of death.
