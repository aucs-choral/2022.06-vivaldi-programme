AUCS is a student club affiliated with the Adelaide University Union, founded in 1960. University of Adelaide staff and alumni also sing with the choir. We typically perform two classical concerts per year as well as a contemporary Fringe show. We have performed works from the 1500s to contemporary compositions, including motets and madrigals, masses and songs for the masses.
